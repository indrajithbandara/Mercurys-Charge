# Mercury

"Mercury, the herald diviner-god. Ask and things happen."

Built as a fork from Slack Terminalize, this is a chatbot that can simply be thought of as a script runner. I want to expand out Mercury with additional ease-of-life functionality for chatroom management.

Description from the original project:

"Helps build a command-line system in Slack, to create a custom vocabulary for your bot."
